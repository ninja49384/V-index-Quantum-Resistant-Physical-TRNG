V-index Quantum Resistant Physical TRNG

This is an innovative, web based True Random Number Generator (TRNG) that uses environmental entropy (physical noise) to generate unbreakable encryption keys. The project is based on the V-index, which measures the system’s information density and stability. It is the first open‑source project that integrates acoustically validated entropy, measured by the V‑Index, into modern browser CSPRNG engines, creating a physically grounded, quantum‑resistant layer accessible to everyone.

V-index
Preprint: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18147084

The V-index is a physical metric describing the relationship between information (I), energy (a), and entropy (AS).

The program analyzes the analog signal coming through the microphone in real time and computes its V-index.
V < 1.5: Low entropy (silence or monotonous noise). For security reasons, the system shuts down the generator.
V > 1.5: This state represents the highest level of natural balance and complexity, ideal for quantum‑resistant keys.

Why Quantum‑Resistant?
Most modern cryptography is based on mathematical algorithms that future quantum computers (e.g., using Shor’s algorithm) will be able to break.
In contrast, the V-index Quantum Resistant Physical TRNG uses physical entropy.
No pattern: The key is based on the chaotic movement of air molecules and hardware thermal noise.

Unrecoverable: Since the source is not an equation but a one time physical event, there is no mathematical model that could reconstruct the key afterward.
Entropy Gate: The system only allows key extraction if the V-index confirms the presence of external physical interaction (noise), thereby excluding weak, software-based randomness.

Usage

Start the application in an HTTPS‑based environment (e.g., GitHub Pages).
Click the INITIALIZE SYSTEM button.
Create physical noise (paper crumpling, whispering, air movement, anything).
Once the V-index reaches the secure range, the HARVEST KEY button becomes active.
Click the button to generate the 24‑character unique key.

Compliance and Security Standards

The V-index Quantum Resistant Physical TRNG follows the international cybersecurity principles and standards below during the key generation process:

1. NIST SP 800‑90B (Entropy Sources for RNGs)
The program complies with NIST requirements that the random number generator must originate from a non‑deterministic physical source (Non‑Deterministic Random Bit Generator).
Noise Source: Atmospheric and quantum thermal noise via the Web Audio API.
V‑Index Validation: Functions as a “Health Test,” immediately shutting down generation if the entropy level drops below the critical threshold.

2. AIS 31 (Class PTG.2)
According to the German BSI standard, the system can be categorized as PTG.2. This means the randomness originates from a physical process, and the system includes an internal mechanism (the V-index) that detects statistical faults or external manipulation (e.g., if someone tries to “train” the generator with a pure sine wave).

3. FIPS 140‑2 (Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules)
Although not dedicated hardware, the software implements continuous self‑testing as required by FIPS standards:
Continuous RNG Test: Before each “harvest,” the V‑index analyzes the current block. If the input data is repetitive or static (V < 1.5), the system refuses to release the key.

4. Quantum‑Resistant Cryptography (Post‑Quantum Readiness)
Since key generation does not depend on mathematical algorithms (e.g., RSA or ECC), the system is immune to Grover‑algorithm‑based brute‑force attacks by quantum computers, assuming the generated key length is sufficient (256‑bit equivalent).

5. ISO/IEC 18031:2011
The standard requires whitening of noise sources. The V-index Quantum Resistant Physical TRNG performs this via XOR‑based bit extraction, where the physical sampling (rawData) is combined with the dynamic V-index value to ensure uniform distribution in the output key.

Randomness Verification (Statistical Testing)
To ensure the quality of keys generated by V‑Entropy, the output data must undergo industry‑standard statistical tests. The generated keys are examined according to the following principles:
1. Dieharder and NIST STS Tests
The following NIST Statistical Test Suite parameters can be applied to the generated bitstreams:

Frequency (Monobit) Test: Checks whether the ratio of 0s to 1s is close to 50–50%.
Runs Test: Verifies that there are no excessively long, uniform bit sequences.
Spectral Test: Confirms that no repeating patterns (periodicity) appear in the key.

2. Entropy Density Analysis (Shannon Entropy)
Parallel to V-index measurement, the Shannon entropy (H) of the output keys approaches the theoretical maximum. For a 24‑character key where each character carries ~6 bits of information, the target is:
H = log₂(n)
where n is the number of possible characters.
The V-index > 1.5 requirement guarantees that output density does not fall below the critical threshold.

3. How You Can Test It Yourself
To verify generated keys, we recommend using the following command line tool (Linux/macOS):

(Save 1000 generated keys to a file, then run the ent tool)

ent generated_keys.txt

The ent program displays information content, chi‑square distribution, and arithmetic mean, proving the authenticity of the physical source.
